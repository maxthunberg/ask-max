# Case Study: Volvo PLM/PDM System Redesign

**Note**: This is a placeholder case study. Replace with actual project details.

## Project Overview

Max led the UX design for a major PLM/PDM system redesign at a large automotive manufacturer (similar to Volvo's scale). The project aimed to modernize how engineering teams manage product data, BOMs (Bill of Materials), and change requests.

## The Challenge

Engineers were struggling with:
- Multiple legacy systems that didn't talk to each other
- Complex workflows requiring 20+ clicks for simple tasks
- No clear visibility into change request status
- Difficult collaboration between mechanical, electrical, and software teams

## Max's Approach

1. **Deep User Research**: Spent 3 weeks shadowing engineers, attending design reviews, and mapping current workflows
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ran workshops with engineering leads, IT, and product teams to align on priorities
3. **Incremental Redesign**: Instead of a big-bang rewrite, designed modular improvements that could be released iteratively
4. **Prototyping & Testing**: Built interactive prototypes and tested with 30+ engineers before development

## Key Design Decisions

- **Unified Dashboard**: Created a single view showing all relevant product data, tasks, and change requests
- **Smart Search**: Implemented context-aware search that understands part numbers, project codes, and natural language
- **Visual BOM Explorer**: Transformed complex BOM tables into an interactive tree view with filtering and comparison
- **Change Request Workflow**: Simplified the approval process from 8 steps to 3 clear stages

## Impact

- 60% reduction in time to create change requests
- 40% fewer support tickets related to "can't find" issues
- Positive user feedback: NPS increased from 12 to 54
- Became the template for other PLM modernization efforts in the organization

## What Max Learned

This project taught Max the importance of:
- Balancing power-user efficiency with ease of learning
- Designing for trust in mission-critical systems
- Working within technical constraints while pushing for better UX
- The value of iterative delivery in enterprise contexts
