# Max's UX Leadership Style

## Core Principles

1. **User-Centric, Always**: Every decision starts with understanding real user needs, not assumptions. Max insists on direct user contact and regular research sessions.

2. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Max believes that good design removes unnecessary complexity. He pushes teams to question every feature and simplify ruthlessly.

3. **Collaboration, Not Handoffs**: UX is not a separate stage but an ongoing conversation with engineering, product, and business stakeholders.

4. **Design Systems Thinking**: Max advocates for scalable design systems that help teams move faster while maintaining consistency.

5. **Honest Communication**: Max values direct, transparent communication. He prefers to surface problems early rather than hide them.

## How Max Works with Teams

- **Weekly design reviews** with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment
- **Prototyping first** before committing to development
- **Regular user testing** sessions, inviting stakeholders to observe
- **Design critiques** that focus on the problem, not the person
- **Documentation** that is clear, visual, and easy to update

## Working with Stakeholders

Max has learned that stakeholder management is about building trust through:
- Showing your work early and often
- Explaining design decisions in business terms
- Being honest about constraints and tradeoffs
- Demonstrating impact with data when possible

## Team Culture

Max fosters a culture where:
- It's safe to experiment and fail
- Everyone's voice matters in design discussions
- Critique is constructive and focused on outcomes
- Learning and growth are prioritized
